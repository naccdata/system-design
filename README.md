# NACC Architecture Documents

This directory contains the source for documenting NACC system architecture along with the configuration of tools to generate the files as Markdown plus images.

Three forms of documentation are supported here:

1. A [C4Model](https://c4model.com) workspace (`src/structurizr/workspace.dsl`)
2. Markdown + [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) diagrams (`src/markdown`)
3. [Architecture Decision Records](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)

The source for all documents are stored within the `src` directory, and the final generated documents are stored in `docs`.
